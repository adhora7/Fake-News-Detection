# Fake News Detection



A machine learning project that detects **fake vs real news articles** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Python**.  

The model is trained on labeled news data and achieves strong classification performance.

## Features



- Text preprocessing with \*\*NLTK\*\* (stopwords removal, lemmatization)

- **TF-IDF** vectorization with unigrams and bigrams

- Binary classification: **REAL (0)** vs **FAKE (1)**

- Interactive user input for real-time prediction

## Models & Techniques



- Logistic Regression (primary model)

- TF-IDF Vectorizer

- Train-test split with stratification

- Performance evaluation using accuracy and classification report



**Accuracy achieved:** ~94%
